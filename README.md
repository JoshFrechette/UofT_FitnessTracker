# Directions for the project

- The user chooses to either continue their workout ("Continue Workout" button), create a new workout ("New Workout" button) or view their total workout stats ("dashboard" from the navigation bar.
- If the user chooses to either continue a workout or create a new workout, they will be directed to the workout page where they will be prompted to enter the exercise info.
- If the user chooses to view their stats, they will be navigated to the stats page where all their exercise data for the week will be aggregated and charted through visualization.
